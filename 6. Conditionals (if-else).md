# Conditionals

## Logic operations

Every logic operator gives boolean as a result

```python
a = 5
b = 7
c = 3

equal = a == b  # >>> False
not_equal = a != b  # >>> True
not_equal = !(a == b)  # >>> True (another approach)
more_than = a > b  # >>> False
less_than = a < b  # >>> True
more_or_equal = a >= b  # >>> False
less_or_equal = a <= b  # >>> True
```

>> NB! `=` is very differ from `==`

We can chain logic operations by `and` and `or` operators. Also we can use `not` word

```python
and_operator = a != b and not b == c
# >>> True (5 != 7 and 7 not == 3)

or_operator = a > b or c < b
# >>> True (5 > 7 or 3 < 7, 3 is less than 7)
```

Truth tables for `not`, `and` and `or` operations are below, where 1 means `True` and 0 means `False`

| `a` | `not a` |
| --- | ------- |
| 0   | 1       |
| 1   | 0       |

| `a` | `b` | `a or b` |
| --- | --- | -------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0        |
| 0   | 1   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 1   | 1        |

| `a` | `b` | `a and b` |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0         |
| 0   | 1   | 0         |
| 1   | 0   | 0         |
| 1   | 1   | 1         |

## If ... else

`if`, `else` and `elif` statements are used to perform different actions based on given conditions.

The `if` statement will execute code if condition returns `True` as a result.

```python
age = 30
if age > 16:
    print('You are old enough to drive')
else:
    print('You are not old enough to drive')
```

>> Pay attention to indentations. Whitespaces is used to group blocks of code in Python. Use the same number of proceeding spaces for every code block

If you want to check for multiple conditions, use `elif` statements. Keep in mind that after first "true" condition it will stop and not check conditions that follow.

So if we write this

```python
if age >= 16:
    print('You are old enough to drive a car')
elif age >= 21:
    print('You are old enough to drive a tractor trailer')
else:
    print('You are not old enough to drive')
```

instead of this

```python
if age >= 21:
    print('You are old enough to drive a tractor trailer')
elif age >= 16:
    print('You are old enough to drive a car')
else:
    print('You are not old enough to drive')
```

it would never let to drive a tractor trailer.

We can combine conditions with logical operators `and`, `or` or `not`

We can fix a program above with this

```python
if age >= 16 and age < 21:
    print('You are old enough to drive a car')
elif age >= 21:
    print('You are old enough to drive a tractor trailer')
else:
    print('You are not old enough to drive')
```

But do we really need to do so?
